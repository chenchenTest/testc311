When authorized by us, aSpecial Media and its business partners may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.

                    <p>GNum’s Products and Services, the Site and/or App may use data collection devices such as “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons to personalise your online experience, help analyze our Site and/or App flow and measure promotional effectiveness. “Cookies” are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our Products and Services. We may offer features that are only available through the use of a “cookie”. We also use cookies to reduce the number of times you need to enter your password. Cookies may also help us provide to you information targeted in accordance to your interests. Most browsers automatically accept cookies but you can modify your browser to decline cookies (if your browser permits you to do so), although in such a case you may not be able to access certain features on our Site or some interactive features offered on our Site may be restricted or rendered inoperable.</p>
                    <p>Our Site may allow third parties (for example, analytics firms and business partners) to download cookies to your device. These third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect non-personal data about your online activities while you are using our Site.

                    <p>This Site uses plug-ins from the social network Facebook, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. If you access a page on our Site that contains a plug-in, your browser will establish a direct link to Facebook’s servers. The plug-in content will then be sent directly to your browser by Facebook and included on the relevant web page. Facebook will be notified that your browser has accessed the corresponding page of our Site, even if you do not have a Facebook account or if you are not logged on to your Facebook account. You IP address will be sent directly by your browser to a Facebook server in the USA and registered on that server.</p>
                    <p>If you are logged on to Facebook when you browse our Site, Facebook may directly link your visit to our Site, to your Facebook account. If, for example, you click on ‘Like’ or leave a comment on Facebook in relation to our Site while using a plug-in, the corresponding information will be transmitted to and registered on a Facebook server and published on your Facebook account. Facebook may use such information for advertising and market research purposes, and may adapt its pages accordingly. Facebook may therefore create user profiles including information about users’ interests and relationships, to determine how users react after having seen an advertisement on Facebook, inform other Facebook users about the activity of our Website and offer other services linked to Facebook</p>
                    <p>If you do not wish Facebook to link information collected via our Site to your Facebook account, you should log out of Facebook before visiting our Site.</p>
