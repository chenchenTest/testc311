You acknowledge and agree that any unauthorized use of the Products and Services and/or breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to GNum for which damages alone would be inadequate. Accordingly, GNum shall be entitled to and have the right to the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of the terms of this Agreement and/or any unauthorised use of the Site, App and/or the Products and Services.<br/>
                        11.2. Assignment. The Customer shall not, without the prior written consent of GNum, assign, transfer, charge or otherwise deal in any other similar manner with all or any of its rights under this Agreement, subcontract any or all of its obligations under this Agreement, or purport to do any of the same.<br/>
                        11.3. Remedies and Waivers. No failure on the part of GNum to exercise, and no delay on its part in exercising, any right or remedy under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights provided in under this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. If GNum does waive a default by the Customer, it will only do so in writing.<br/>
                        11.4. No Rights of Third Parties. A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, Chapter 53B of Singapore, to enforce any term of this Agreement, but this does not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available apart from the said Act.<br/>
                        11.5. Severability. The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement under the law of any jurisdiction shall not affect its legality, validity or enforceability under the law of any other jurisdiction nor the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision.<br/>
                        11.6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Singapore without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The Parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of Singapore.
